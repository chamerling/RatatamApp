## Notes

I originally launched Ratatam as a paid application on the Mac App Store in 2012. As of today (11/2013), the application has been downloaded hundreds of times and got quite good feedback from users.

I am not an Objective-C developer, I started to lean it while developing some OS X apps so there are probably lots of bugs, bad patterns, and obviously memory leaks (come on guys I am a Java developer ;) ).

Today I have other challenges and no more time to work on the application so I decided to open source it.

Let's bring RatatammApp to a new level : Fork it and send your pull requests!
