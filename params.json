As of today (11/2013), the application has been downloaded hundreds of times and got quite good feedback from users.\r\n\r\nI am not an Objective-C developer, I started to lean it while developing some OS X apps so there are probably lots of bugs, bad patterns, and obviously memory leaks (come on guys I am a Java developer ;) ).\r\n\r\nToday I have other challenges and no more time to work on the application so I decided to open source it.\r\n\r\nLet's bring RatatammApp to a new level : Fork it and send your pull requests!\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n- Christophe Hamerling\r\n- You!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Christophe Hamerling <christophe.hamerling@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
